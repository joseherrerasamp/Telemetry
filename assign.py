    SATELLITE'S TELEMETRY ANALYSIS
    Description: The code here implemented is my personal work
    trying to analyse a satellite's telemetry file.

    This small script tries to find out all the telemetry data
    which is contained in a binary file, parse it, extract some of the
    info and then create a new file to be exported to STK.

        length starting from byte 112 position in data
        - Attitude quaternions are int32 data types so they are 4 bytes in length

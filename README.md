# Telemetry
Satellite's telemetry analysis using Python. 

Binary file "telemetry.bin" contains all the telemetry
information of a certain satellite. I will try to parse 
all this information according to an EXCEL file which 
describes how is the information stored on the binary file. 

Using DataScience mechanisms, I will parse and extract 
the information regarding time, orbital position and 
attitude. This information will then be stored in files 
that can be imported to STK to perform scenario simulations.

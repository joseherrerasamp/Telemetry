# Telemetry
Satellite's telemetry analysis using Python. 

The code here developed is used to extract from a 
TELEMETRY file the information concerning time, 
orbit position and attitude from a given satellite.

Datascience mechanisms are used to extract the data 
in the FILE (binary file) and then this data is 
exported to different STK files extensions. This files 
could then be imported in a STK scenario for simulation.
